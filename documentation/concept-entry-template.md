Title: 'Sklearn ensembles' 

Description: 'Sklearn or scikit-learn is an ensemble, which is an method to combine multiple machine learning models to make advanced models which are far more superior than individual models.They can correct erros and allow your item to have better, imporved, overall performance.'

**Clustering**

    'Clustering in Sklearn is using different techniques to group data that is identical depending on their features. Clustering only happens when you use different algorithims each with their own pros and cons. There are many algorithims for example there are [Kmeans] and there also are [Hierachical clustering].There are so many more algorithims. This is just the tip of the iceberg.'



**Regression**

    'Unlike the first concept, Regression is a set of suprevised learning techniques used to manipulate and figure out continous values based and featues the user inputs. Regression helps with and is suitable for different types of problems and data.'

**Cross-Validation**

    'Cross-validation in Sklearn is one of the many techniques to evaluate the performance and generalizability of a machine learning model. It sends the data in different sets and keeps on training the model. For example you can use KFold as a method and also use LeavePOut. There are many more but that was an brief summary'
